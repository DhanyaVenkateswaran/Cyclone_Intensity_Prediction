# Cyclone_Intensity_Prediction

A machine learning project to predict the intensity of a cyclone that is still forming/about to hit the shore based on the entered parameters. The input parameter can be either a satellite image using which the exact intensity can be predicted or just a sequence of parameter values using which the impact it will have can be estimated.
