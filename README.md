# Cyclone_Intensity_Prediction

A machine learning project to predict the intensity of a cyclone that is still forming/about to hit the shore based on the entered parameters. The input parameter can be either a satellite image using which the exact intensity can be predicted or just a sequence of estimation parameters like wind speed, wind direction, cloud depth, cloud density, etc; using which the impact can be estimated.
